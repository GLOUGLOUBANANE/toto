# Bouncing Ball Game

This repository contains a simple game featuring a red ball bouncing around a starry background, with each rebound slightly randomized. Two versions are provided:

- **Python/Pygame** (`bouncing_ball.py`) – run locally on your machine.
- **Web version** (`index.html`) – open directly in any modern browser.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `pygame` library

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game

Execute the following command from the repository root:

```bash
python bouncing_ball.py
```

A window will open showing a red ball bouncing off the edges of a starry black background. The bounce angle includes a touch of randomness for added challenge. Close the window to quit.

## Playing in the Browser

To try the game without installing anything, simply open `index.html` in your
browser. The canvas shows the same starry backdrop, and the ball's rebound gains
a slight random nudge each time it hits a wall.
