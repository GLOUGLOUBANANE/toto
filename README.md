# Bouncing Ball Game

This repository contains a simple game featuring a red ball bouncing around the screen. Two versions are provided:

- **Python/Pygame** (`bouncing_ball.py`) – run locally on your machine.
- **Web version** (`index.html`) – open directly in any modern browser.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- `pygame` library

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Running the Game

Execute the following command from the repository root:

```bash
python bouncing_ball.py
```

A window will open showing a red ball bouncing off the edges of the screen. Close the window to quit.

## Playing in the Browser

To try the game without installing anything, simply open `index.html` in your
browser. The red ball should start bouncing immediately.
